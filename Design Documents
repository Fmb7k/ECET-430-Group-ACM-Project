Major Moving Parts:
 - Dial for controlling pots on band-pass filter

Sections: (block diagram)

Priorities:
 - Filter/component values, potentiometer and gears to tune to desired frequency
 - Antenna
 - Amplifier
 - Demodulator
 - Speaker
 - Microcontroller integration

Dependencies:
 - Need to size the mechanical aspect to the layout of the band-pass filter's potentiometers
 - Amplifier settings determined based on antenna output

Architecture: Implementation Options:
-Frequency tuning methods
using knobs and gears to tune potentiometers to change frequencies
knobs located on front or top of device
-Menu navigation
Using either buttons or knobs that are connected to a microcontroller to navigate
-Menu implementation
4x24 LCD screen displaying necessary information
-Speakers
Speakers mounted next to LCD screen on both sides


Modules for prototype:
 - Band-pass filter with tunable potentiometers
	- Possibly with the antenna
