Major Moving Parts:
 - Dial for controlling pots on band-pass filter

Sections: (block diagram)

Priorities:
 - Filter/component values, potentiometer and gears to tune to desired frequency
 - Antenna
 - Amplifier
 - Demodulator
 - Speaker
 - Microcontroller integration

Dependencies:
 - Need to size the mechanical aspect to the layout of the band-pass filter's potentiometers
 - Amplifier settings determined based on antenna output

Architecture: Implementation Options:

Modules for prototype:
 - Band-pass filter with tunable potentiometers
	- Possibly with the antenna
