Major Moving Parts:
 - Dial for controlling pots on band-pass filter

Sections: (block diagram)

Priorities:
 - Filter/component values, potentiometer and gears to tune to desired frequency
 - Antenna
 - Amplifier
 - Demodulator
 - Speaker
 - Microcontroller integration

Dependencies:
 - Need to size the mechanical aspect to the layout of the band-pass filter's potentiometers
 - Amplifier settings determined based on antenna output

Architecture: Implementation Options:
-Frequency tuning methods
using knobs and gears to tune potentiometers to change frequencies
knobs located on front or top of device
-Menu navigation
Using either buttons or knobs that are connected to a microcontroller to navigate
-Menu implementation
4x24 LCD screen displaying necessary information
-Speakers
Speakers mounted next to LCD screen on both sides


Modules for prototype:
 - Band-pass filter with tunable potentiometers
	- Possibly with the antenna


Options you considered as microcontrollers 
We considered the Arduino Uno R3 and the raspberry pi
Which one you chose
We chose the Arduino Uno R3
Why
We chose it because we are familiar with working with it, as Seven is currently taking 311, and Max has already taken 311 and 411. Our final product doesn't need anything specific that other microprossessors can offer, 
and we think that it would be better to save costs for us and time getting used to working with other types of microprocessors. 
Items you need to start working with it, like IDE, compiler, toolchain, hardware/software debugging tools
We will be using the arduino IDE to work with it.
