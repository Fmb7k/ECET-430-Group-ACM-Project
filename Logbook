2 big ideas from first class
Desk fan with programmable speeds and oscillation angles and timer
Battery Powered
Headphone rack with buttons for rotation, USB ports, and RGB LEDs
Wall Outlet Powered
Headphone rack idea feels a little barebones, could explore some more creative additions to the build
started git repo, didnt fully understand how to set it up

Created Project Definitions for two ideas
Temperature sensor Desk fan and Daily Planner Radio

1/26/2025 Class
High level Design notes
probably need a dim backlight for LCD screen
Create flowcharts of how things actually connect to each other
Battery USB example from class was important
Document core design decisions, come to these decisions by using the flowcharts
things like voltage and current regulation are to be considered
Things like cost vs efficiency matter here. 
Edited Project Definitions during class

talked about prototyping
what function is most important for us to be able to prototype in a week
I think bandpass filter functionality is most important
before we start trying audio output, just having a working idea of making a filter that outputs at the specifications we give it.
Looks-like Prototype (3D print a smaller cale model maybe)
Works-like Prototype (Get bandpass filter working with AM)
Engineering Prototype (design model that can hold bandpass filter)
can use a knob with gears that will tune parts of filter at same time to keep them synced
Need a demodulator that will take signal and output to a speaker somehow
Focus on AM radio first, microcontroller can tell you what frequency is being read
DISCUSSION FROM CLASS (3 IDEAS)
RECIEVER
ANTENNA
DEMODULATION 
OP AMP 
HAVE AN ARDUINO DISPLAY FREQUENCY FROM FILTER

Circuit of the day was 100nF capacitor
used to reduce noise as a decoubpling capacitor for the various active parts of a circuit
because we are using a DAC for our radio transmitter this is very important to us, and we need to research a different kind of capacitor to transmit 
information accurately
Make test programs that you can run to test if everything is still working as you add onto the project
Unit tests

Start with low level verification code
verify basic functions will work before proceeding 
use mock functions with made up values to test things without using hardware
Have overvoltage / overcurrent protection on external inputs? 
- Does the radio signal need to be protected
Capacitors for audio stuff need special consideration 
Need Op-Amps that work within power budget and don't overheat
Integrated Circuits should be #1 thing to design around
How to design around standard outlet power and cable
maybe run numbers on heat 
Power budget is sum of power consumption of all components 
Ex: Arduino takes 7V 50mA, Servo takes 5V 150mA, Display takes 5V 100mA 
Calculate Power from total V and I
Power = 350 + 750 + 500 = 1600mW 
This ballpark lets you make other design considerations later

We have design decisions we need to make
should signal process go through arduino or not (probably no)
what does the arduino actually need to do
arduino can display resonant frequency of bandpass filter
arduino also has bandpass filter implementation that can be done on the software side

Created AM bandpass filter prototype for presentation

Talked about switching regulators in class
Using linear regulators in certain situations can be inefficient due to wasting input voltage power, or if output voltage needed fluctuates too much
Switching regulators can fix this problem
Switching is not always better, efficiency and cost need to be considered overall
24 bit adc
https://microchip.my.site.com/s/article/Calculating-crystal-load-capacitor 
crystal capacitor clock stuff ^^^^
dynamic range audio stuff discussed in class
need to be very fine
100nF capacitor is good for high frequency filtering
4.7nF capacitor is good for regulating voltage spikes, smoothes voltage out

consider using an IF amplifier, IF amplifier is used after bandpass filter, but before rectifier
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate-frequency_amplifier 
Trace width and spacing considerations in class
too small traces will be hard to print, larger traces be easy to print and cost less
spacing also needs to be considered between traces
1 mil = 1/1000 inch
*** need to convert from RF signal to AF signal
Heterodyning is a big issue that we failed to consider, also I don't know if I can pay for all of the components we need.
seems like if we want to have functionality at a reasonable quality, I'm gonna have to pay a lot for components which is a problem.
Long term we can't use a bandpass filter for our usecase, we have to use heterodyning with a mixer to actually get to the frequencies that we need. 
Superheterodyne Receiver:
A superheterodyne receiver uses heterodyning to shift the frequency of a received signal to a fixed intermediate frequency (IF), where it's easier to amplify and filter. A bandpass filter is used in a superheterodyne receiver to select the desired signal and reject unwanted frequencies. 
We need this^^^ which might be hard, basically an addition to the prototype that we had.
I don't believe we can use the Arduino as the local oscillator needed for the superhet, we might need to switch to a different uC as well

component selection shopping stuff can be done on digikey or mouser or octopart
Our components need to have very good tolerance because the inaccuracy of our parts will lead to a buildup of noise or other flaws over the course of the reciever
Our priority is having our sound be as high quality as possible, so having inaccuracy will lead to an unacceptable output.
