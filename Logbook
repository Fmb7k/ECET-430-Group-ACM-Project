2 big ideas from first class
Desk fan with programmable speeds and oscillation angles and timer
Battery Powered
Headphone rack with buttons for rotation, USB ports, and RGB LEDs
Wall Outlet Powered
Headphone rack idea feels a little barebones, could explore some more creative additions to the build
started git repo, didnt fully understand how to set it up

Created Project Definitions for two ideas
Temperature sensor Desk fan and Daily Planner Radio

1/26/2025 Class
High level Design notes
probably need a dim backlight for LCD screen
Create flowcharts of how things actually connect to each other
Battery USB example from class was important
Document core design decisions, come to these decisions by using the flowcharts
things like voltage and current regulation are to be considered
Things like cost vs efficiency matter here. 
Edited Project Definitions during class

talked about prototyping
what function is most important for us to be able to prototype in a week
I think bandpass filter functionality is most important
before we start trying audio output, just having a working idea of making a filter that outputs at the specifications we give it.
Looks-like Prototype (3D print a smaller cale model maybe)
Works-like Prototype (Get bandpass filter working with AM)
Engineering Prototype (design model that can hold bandpass filter)
can use a knob with gears that will tune parts of filter at same time
Need a demodulator that will take signal and output to a speaker somehow
Focus on AM radio first, microcontroller can tell you what frequency is being read
