prefab amp for radio, different classes of amplifiers (power consumption )
We do not need to actually design the amps for the radio, can use prefabricated ones from amazon that match our specifications
We want to keep the speaker/amp side of things simple because it needs to be able to work with our microcontroller.

Tank circuit resonant frequency 
f r = 1 2 Ï€ L C
using variable capacitor with a constant inductor value will allow us to tune to specific frequencies
the only requirement for the inductor is that it allows the frequency response to go between the frequency values we specify, we want these to correspond with
AM radio station frequencies

^^^ helpful information for radio wave stuff
Hyperphysics website is VERY helpful, has examples and explanations for legit everything we need.

Superheterodyne reciever is what we need to add to our reciever for it to be able to switch between stations.
